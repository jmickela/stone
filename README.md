# stone

This is a very early work in progress. This tool is meant to run as a web server and allow a site themer to use css regression testing tools to check on their progress while themeing a site.

When finished Stone will run as a Flask app which will offer an api that can be called to perform pre-defined tests, maybe through a configureation file, or, if possible, built on the fly. There will also be a Chrome extension made to integrate with the web service so you can check your progress right from chrome without having to open other tools.
